vim_subword
by Mike Hordecki
----------------

vim_subword adds a new text object to your vim, namely a subword text object.

A subword is either aPartOfACamelCasedWord, or_a_part_of_an_underscored_word.

The symbol for the text object is - (dash). 

Usage
-----

If you don't know what text objects are, type `:h text-objects`. This
module adds a new text object, -. You can use it with all of the regular
text object commands, so `ci-`, `da-`, etc. should all work. There is some
way to go to get 100% parity with builin text objects, though. See TODO
section for details.


Installation
------------

You can copy this package on top of your ~/.vim or use pathogen and drop it
into ~/.vim/bundle.


Hacking
-------

There is a test suite attached to the code. I recommend py.test as a test driver.
